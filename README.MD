# Bubbles Advanced Anti Cheat Engine

Bubbles Advanced Anti Cheat Engine (BAACE) is designed to detect the use of YOLO models (PyTorch `.pt` files, ONNX models, TensorRT `.engine` files) and other cheating mechanisms in video games. It combines memory scanning, file system monitoring, process analysis, behavioral analysis, and device detection to provide comprehensive protection against cheats.

## File Descriptions

- `memory_scanner.py`: Scans the memory of game-related processes to detect loaded YOLO model files and other cheat signatures.
- `file_monitor.py`: Monitors the file system in real-time to detect access to potential cheat files.
- `process_analysis.py`: Analyzes running processes to detect suspicious modules and behavior.
- `behavior_analysis.py`: Uses machine learning to detect unusual in-game behavior indicative of cheating.
- `alert_system.py`: Implements a real-time alert system to notify administrators when cheats are detected.
- `ban_system.py`: Provides functionality to ban players caught using cheats.
- `data_reporting.py`: Collects and reports data on detected cheats to improve the anti-cheat system over time.
- `device_detection.py`: Detects the use of Arduino devices, DMA devices, ViGEmBus devices, and HidHide devices used for cheating.
